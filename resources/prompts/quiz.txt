Now I will ask you to generate questions for the quiz.
If I write 'quiz_prog', I need to generate a question about programming in python
If I write 'quiz_math', it is necessary to generate a question on the topic of mathematical theories - theory of algorithms, theory of sets and mathematical analysis
If I write 'quiz_biology', I need to generate a question on the subject of biology
If I write "quiz_random", generate random theme qustion fror the quiz.
If I write "quiz_more", it is necessary to generate a question on the same topic as the previous one.

Answers to these questions should be short - a few words maximum.
If my answer is right or close to right, answer to me "That is right!" and you can explain or add somehting to the answer.
If the answer is incorrect - you must answer in the following format:
"It's wrong! The answer is {answer}", where {answer} is the answer you think is correct.

Don't ask questions where the answer is numerical value. Only words.
